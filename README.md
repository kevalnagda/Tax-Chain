# Tax-Chain

## Motivation
Tax fraud is at an all time rise in India, having men go through Income Tax returns would always have a weak point in the system. Block chains not only provide a secure but a completely transparent system for the citizens and the government. 
Tax-Chain has an intuitive frontend which completely eliminates the typical "Business Year End" system and replaces Chartered Accountants by having a straighforward process of uploading receipts of payments made throughout the year. Using Optical Character Recognition, we remove the transaction amount automatically from the receipts (Further eliminating fraud from users inputting incorrect values) All these transactions get stored in a blockchain along with the IT return of the user.
This provides COMPLETE transparency as changing a transaction would change  its hash, thus breaking the user's chain.
Our system aims to enhance the digital India program and eliminate black money.

## Problems we aim to tackle
- **Lack in consistency of income tax data collection**
    
- **Time spent behind collecting the data**
  
- **Fraud and Theft of data**


## Detail
- **Data collection**
    Data Collection is done by the user itself as he/she uploads the relevant data.
- **Data storage**
    Data Storage is done in the block chain which essentially means there can be no alteration to the data once it is uploaded and hashed. 
- **Data Retrival**
    Data can be retrived by a locally hosted web application which is built using PHP, HTML & CSS. Material design guidelines have been followed to ensure the best UI/UX.
